I'm a software engineer at [**Fathom Health**](https://fathomhealth.com) working on using maching learning to automate medical coding.

I graduated from Purdue University in December 2019 where I studied [Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/undergraduate/curriculum/track_MI.html) and [Mathematical Statistics](http://catalog.purdue.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=9&poid=10329).

Aside from my professional life, I love to cook and am setting up a food blog.
